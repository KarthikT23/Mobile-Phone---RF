An antenna is a specialized transducer that converts radio-frequency (RF) fields into alternating current (AC) or vice-versa.
There are two basic types: the receiving antenna, which intercepts RF energy and delivers AC to electronic equipment, and the transmitting antenna, which is fed with AC from electronic equipment and generates an RF field.
Older phones used external antennas while most current phones use an internal antenna. 
The size and shape of the antenna is designed according to the type of radio waves being used.
